# [DSA](../README.md) / Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is a technique in computer programming that helps to efficiently solve a class of problems that have <b>overlapping subproblems</b> and <b>optimal substructures</b> property.

## Ways of DP

-   Memoization (Top Down) -> Recursive approach
-   Tabulation (Bottom Up) -> Iterative approach
